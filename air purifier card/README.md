Some Lovelace setup

I showed my Lovelace config to Home Assistant group on the well known social network and many people asked me to share it. I guess this is the best way of sharing.
Please note I use the storage mode, therefore maybe you will need some modification in yaml mode.
I like to play with the Lovelace config and I wanted to make my uniqe setup.
I hope my config helps to make your unique config too!
Many thanx for the people from the Home Assistant Community (https://community.home-assistant.io/) who give me more inspiration and ideas for this job!!!
